# Domain Setup

1. Set up domain in repo settings
In your repository, go to Settings > Pages > Custom domain. Write your domain without www.

2. Pull changes
Step 1 will add a CNAME file to your deployment branch —e.g. main. Remember to pull those changes in your local: git checkout main && git pull --allow-unrelated-histories.

3. Configure DNS in GoDaddy
3.1 Add an A record
Point your root domain to the GitHub Pages IP. Make sure to look at the updated IPs here. I took 185.199.108.153.

3.2 Add a CNAME record
Point www to your original GitHub pages domain. Do this by adding a CNAME record from www to <username>.github.io.

4. Add verified domain
Add your custom domain to your GitHub account —read acount, not repo.
